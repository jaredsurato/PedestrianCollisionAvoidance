# PedestrianCollisionAvoidance
The prototype for the Pedestrian Collision Avoidance System (PCAS) is a simple one. It does not require any configuration on the user end. It uses the Canvas web API for drawing 2D graphics.
The prototype displays different buttons corresponding to the different scenarios that the PCAS should be able to handle. Clicking a button plays the animation corresponding to its scenario. 
Once an animation is complete, to successfully play they next scenario's animation without it any issues, a reset button is provided to return the pedestrian and vehicle to their original positions.
